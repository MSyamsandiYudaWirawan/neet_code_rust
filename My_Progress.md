## Next Steps

Based on the CodeForce Guide and your current progress:

### Immediate Goals (Rating 1000-1400)
- Continue practicing fast implementation
- Focus on simulation and brute force problems
- Practice case division

### Recommended Practice
1. **AtCoder Beginner Contest** - Problems B and C
2. **Fast Coding Practice** - Aim for 5-10 minute solutions
3. **Complete remaining NeetCode problems** in Sliding Window and Stack

### Future Learning Path
- Binary Search
- DFS/BFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Binary Indexed Tree
- Segment Tree (for higher ratings)

---

## Notes
- As a beginner, the guide recommends focusing on AtCoder problems for clean implementation practice
- Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes before checking editorial
- Practice using paper/whiteboard for problem-solving
- Build up speed gradually
